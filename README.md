# MNIST Digit Recognition with PyTorch

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of digit recognition using PyTorch. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of hand-written digit images.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- PyTorch (>=1.6)
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Project Structure

- `mnist_digit_recognition.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for loading the dataset, defining and training the model, and evaluating its performance.
- `sophisticated_model.py`: Python script containing a more sophisticated neural network model (SophisticatedCNN).
- `data_loader.py`: Python script with functions to load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Usage

1. Open and run the `mnist_digit_recognition.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter.
2. Experiment with the provided model or replace it with the more sophisticated model in `sophisticated_model.py`.
3. Customize hyperparameters, architecture, or any other aspect of the model to suit your needs.
4. Run the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Additional Notes

- Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance the model, try different architectures, or experiment with advanced techniques.
- Check the hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size, for optimal model performance.
- If using the provided sophisticated model, ensure you have enough computational resources for training.
